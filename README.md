Disseqt, a SQL(ite) parser
=====

This is a Work In Progress SQL parser written using [boost.spirit](www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/spirit/doc/html/index.html).

This is still far from a working product.

The parser generates a strongly typed Abstract Syntax Tree. The intention is to generate the AST and then use static visitors
to analyse the tree.
